You're good at making both the parts users see (the \"frontend\") and the hidden machinery that makes everything work behind the scenes (the \"backend\"). You're good at designing how different parts of an app talk to each other (\"API design\"), and how to put apps online (\"cloud deployment\"). You care about making things work well, look good, and be easy for people to use.\n\n*   **Your Schooling (Education):** You went to a big university, UC Berkeley, and got a degree in Computer Science, which is basically the study of how computers and software work. You also have a high school diploma.\n\n*   **Your Work Experience (Experience):**\n    *   **TechNova Solutions (Intern):** You worked as an intern, building both the visible parts and the hidden systems for apps. You created the \"backbone\" of apps that made them 20% faster. You also built parts of apps that 5,000+ people used every month, made sure people could log in securely, and wrote special checks to catch problems in the user-facing parts of apps, which reduced errors by 30%.\n    *   **CloudByte Labs (Intern):** You focused on the parts of apps that users see. You built flexible pieces for the app's look and feel, and made the app much faster and smoother (improving its \"Lighthouse score\" from 68 to 92). You made sure the app looked good and worked well on phones and computers, and connected the app to data that helped understand how it was being used.\n\n*   **Things You've Built (Key Projects):**\n    *   **SmartTask Productivity App:** You made a complete app to help people manage their tasks, including reminders and dashboards to see progress. You built in features for users to sign up and manage their own data.\n    *   **AI Recipe Finder:** You created an app that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to suggest recipes based on what you tell it. It can even recognize ingredients and give you step-by-step cooking instructions.\n\n*   **Special Certificates (Certifications):** You've completed official training and earned certificates in making user-facing parts of apps (Meta Front-End Developer Certificate) and in understanding data (Google Data Analytics Certificate).\n\n*   **Your Toolkit (Technical Skills):**\n    *   **Languages:** These are the \"programming languages\" you speak to computers, like JavaScript (a very common one for web), Python (good for many things, including AI), and TypeScript (a more organized version of JavaScript).\n    *   **Frontend:** These are the tools you use to build what users see and interact with, like React (a popular way to build interactive web pages), Next.js (for more advanced web apps), and Tailwind CSS (to style how things look).\n    *   **Backend:** These are tools for the hidden parts of apps, like Node.js and Express.js (to power the server that runs the app), and REST APIs (the rules for how different parts of apps talk to each other).\n    *   **Databases:** These are systems where you store information for apps, like MongoDB and PostgreSQL.\n    *   **Tools:** These are other helpful utilities you use, like Git (for teamwork and tracking changes in code), Docker (to package apps so they run anywhere), Postman (to test APIs), Jest (to test code), and VS Code (your main writing tool for code).\n\n*   **Cool Things You've Done (Achievements):**\n    *   You're very active on GitHub (a place where developers share code), making over 150 contributions in just 3 months.\n    *   You competed in a coding challenge called HackTheFuture 2024 and your team finished in the top 3!\n\n(All information found throughout the resume, categorized and simplified.)\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":57},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ask_agent(\"What job roles am I most suitable for based on my resume?\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-01T06:38:30.713457Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-01T06:38:30.713711Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-01T06:38:33.964577Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-01T06:38:30.713689Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-01T06:38:33.963602Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"2025-12-01 06:38:30,714 -
