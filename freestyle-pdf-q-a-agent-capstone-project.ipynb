They have also finished their high school education.\n*   **Where they've gained work experience (Under Experience):**\n    *   At **Codec Technologies**, they helped build entire websites using a popular set of tools, making them faster to put online. They also set up secure ways to handle user data and made the website's information storage system work quicker.\n    *   At **Skyscanner**, they created a popular part of a travel website that many people use to pick dates. They wrote automatic checks to find mistakes early and made the website load faster for users, also making sure it worked well for everyone.\n*   **Examples of what they've built (Under Key Projects):** They designed a website for a restaurant that looks good and works well on phones, featuring engaging animations. They also built their own personal website to display their work, incorporating special visual effects.\n*   **Extra courses and learning (Under Certifications):** They've completed professional training courses in front-end development (the visible part of websites) and in problem-solving and leadership.\n*   **The tools and languages they use (Under Technical Skills):** They know several computer programming languages (like JavaScript and Python) and use various software tools and systems to build and manage websites and applications.\n*   **Their contributions to shared projects (Under Achievements):** They've actively contributed to public computer coding projects, making over 90 contributions in the last three months, which shows consistent engagement in building things online.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ask_agent(\"What job roles am I most suitable for based on my resume?\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-01T05:50:54.405978Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-01T05:50:54.406315Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-01T05:50:58.557959Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-01T05:50:54.406285Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-01T05:50:58.556955Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"2025-12-01 05:50:54,407 -

Summary  \n  - Skills  \n  - Work experience  \n- The evaluation gave the agent a **10/10 score**, indicating:\n  - High accuracy  \n  - Grounded responses  \n  - Clear structure  \n\n---\n\n# 🚀 Conclusion\n\nThis capstone demonstrates a complete **Freestyle AI Agent** applying key concepts taught in the Google × Kaggle 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course:\n\n✔️ LLM agent  \n✔️ Tools (custom tool)  \n✔️ Memory  \n✔️ Sequential agent behavior  \n✔️ Observability (logging)  \n✔️ Agent evaluation  \n\nThe result is a functional, extendable PDF Q&A assistant that can be improved with features like RAG, multi-agent workflows, or a user interface.\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
